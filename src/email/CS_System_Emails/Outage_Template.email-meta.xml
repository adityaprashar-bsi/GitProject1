We are currently experiencing a delay on: Product
Product Availability: xx/xx/xxxx

*We make every effort to identify an open PO that is: shipping at or around the time that the product will be available, and has the required weight allowance(s).  If we have not noted an adjustment in the, “item status” column, then we were unable to find one with the required qualifications to add to. Please  place on a future order.



We apologize for the inconvenience.



Regards,



Beam Suntory Customer Service
